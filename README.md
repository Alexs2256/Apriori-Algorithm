# 🧠 Apriori Algorithm Project

This project implements the **Apriori Algorithm** in Python for mining frequent itemsets and generating association rules from transaction data. It features a custom implementation without relying on built-in data mining libraries.

The program accepts user-defined support and confidence thresholds to uncover frequent patterns and meaningful associations within a dataset.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/apriori-algorithm.git
    cd apriori-algorithm
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python apriori.py
    ```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

When prompted, enter the minimum support and confidence thresholds (as decimals). The script will then analyze the dataset and output frequent itemsets and association rules.

Example:
```bash
Please enter minimum support: 
0.2
Please enter minimum confidence: 
0.5

Database: Amazon

Rule 1 (2 item set):
{'item1'} --> {'item2'} [support: 30.0%, confidence: 75.0%]
Invalid Rule
-------------------------------
Rule 2 (3 item set):
{'item1', 'item2'} --> {'item3'} [support: 20.0%, confidence: 66.7%]
